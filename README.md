# js_restaurant
A restaurant page made using only javascript

This project was created from The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page?ref=lnav

The general idea is that a restaurant page will be created from javascript only. The aim is to practice using multiple javascript files with their own modules, using webpack to combine them, and manipulating the DOM to populate the HTML.
